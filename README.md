# Welcome!
Thanks for coming! Although it's a lengthy process, nothing good comes easy. Here's how to make your browser cuter.

## 1. Download the browser
So the browser I used is called 'Vivaldi', and it's a super customisable browser. It's just like Chrome, but it's better because it makes your data private and doesn't let advertisers and other people use it (something Chrome does).
Get the latest version for your computer here: https://vivaldi.com/download/ and go to the next step :)

## 2. Set it up initially.
When you open the browser after installation, it will be a bit daunting but the browser team has broken it down into steps for you. Just do what the instructions say, and you'll be done! I personally don't use the speed dial as much, so feel free to disable it.
### To disable the speed dial (quick links on the new tab page):
1. Open a new tab page
2. On the top right, there will be a gear icon (⚙️). Click it
3. In START PAGE -> Click 'Hide' in Navigation, Disable 'Show Add button'
4. Disable the search field, and disable 'Show Delete Speed Dial button'
5. That's it! Have fun with a nice clear new tab page.

## 3. Download the .css file
Download the CSS file in the Releases/Files section
1. Click on the file name
2. Scroll to 'Assets' and open it
3. Click on 'vivaldi.css'
4. It will download on your computer
5. Make a folder, and just place the file in there.
> Also, download the fonts needed in the files (fonts_of_dec.zip)

## 4. Make the browser use your file
1. Go to vivaldi://flags and search for 'Allow CSS modifications'
2. Click on the dropdown, and click 'Enabled'
3. Close and reopen the browser
4. Go to vivaldi:settings/appearance/
5. In the search bar on the top left, search 'Custom UI modifications'
6. Click on 'Select Folder...'
7. Select the folder in which the vivaldi.css file is

> The colors will change depending on your theme.
> Go to vivaldi:settings/themes/ and check out the themes you can get/make! The hearts and everything will be there, but if you specifically want the theme I made, here it is: https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/2zmvzjZPv6g

## That's it!
Just close and reopen your browser, and you'll have a cute browser!
